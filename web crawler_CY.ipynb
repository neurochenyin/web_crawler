       "'Healthcare in the United States is largely provided by private sector healthcare facilities, and paid for by a combination of public programs, private insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. The U.S. is the only developed country without a system of universal healthcare, and a significant proportion of its population lacks health insurance.[2][3][4][5] The United States spends more on healthcare than any other country, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of GDP;[2] however, this expenditure does not necessarily translate into better overall health outcomes compared to other developed nations.[6] Coverage varies widely across the population, with certain groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, receiving more comprehensive care through government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.\\n'"
